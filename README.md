# üè® Hotel Management System

## Overview

The **Hotel Management System** is a console-based application designed to manage room bookings for a fictional hotel named "Hotel Nazara." This project leverages **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to provide a modular, maintainable, and scalable solution. The system allows users to book different types of rooms, generate receipts, and view terms and conditions. It includes error handling to ensure robustness and user-friendly interaction.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Room Booking**: Users can book Deluxe, Premium, or Luxury rooms.
- **Receipt Generation**: Detailed receipts are generated for bookings.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for invalid inputs and unexpected situations.
- **Terms and Conditions**: Display hotel policies and rules.
- **Modular Design**: Uses OOP principles for easy maintenance and scalability.

## üîß OOP Concepts Used

1. **Classes and Objects**: Defines the structure and behavior of various components.
2. **Encapsulation**: Protects data within classes and provides controlled access.
3. **Abstraction**: Simplifies complex systems by exposing only necessary components.
4. **Composition**: Assembles objects using other objects.
5. **Exception Handling**: Manages errors to prevent crashes and ensure smooth execution.
6. **Static Initialization Block**: Initializes static variables when the class is first loaded.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Create a hierarchy for different room types.
- **File I/O for Data Persistence**: Store booking information in files.
- **Database Integration**: Manage room availability and bookings using a database.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Enhance user experience with JavaFX or Swing.
- **User Authentication**: Add user login and registration features.
- **Admin Panel**: Manage room availability, pricing, and bookings.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrate with payment gateways.
- **Feedback System**: Allow users to leave feedback and reviews.
- **Notification System**: Send email/SMS notifications.
